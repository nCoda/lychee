Convert a Lychee-MEI document to a standard MEI document that Verovio will accept.

.. danger:: This module is not fully implemented yet.

.. warning::
    This module is intended for internal *Lychee* use only, so the API may change without notice.
    If you wish to use this module outside *Lychee*, please contact us to discuss the best way.

.. tip::
    We recommend that you use the converters indirectly.
    Refer to :ref:`how-to-use-converters` for more information.

This module runs the same conversions as :mod:`lmei_to_mei`, and makes the following two changes:

#. Convert the document to a string with an XML declaration that uses double quotes. Note that,
   although the XML declaration is not strictly required, and although it may use single quote
   marks around the attribute values, Verovio will not accept such a document.
#. Remove the "mei:" namespace from all tag names. In proper XML, such tag namespaces *may* be
   omitted in some situations, but Verovio again will not attempt to parse an MEI document where
   this is not the situation.

These limitations in Verovio likely arise from the "pugixml" library. They are trivial enough, and
do not require breaking conformance with XML, so we'll just work with what we have.

.. note:: This is an outbound converter that does not emit signals directly. Refer to the
    :mod:`lychee.signals.outbound` module for more information.
